# UnityWPF

This is a  small fork from a repository of a fellow programmer Niklas Moller, who made a project for the Chalmers University of GÃ¶teborg. Main goal was to help him out with some small unwanted behaviours as the showing up of a navigation panel or the disappearance of the Unity Executable when opening a Frame for the second time.
